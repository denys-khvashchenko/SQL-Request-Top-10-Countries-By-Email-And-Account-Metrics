## SQL Query Description

This SQL query is designed to analyze email and account metrics, identify top-performing countries based on these metrics, and present the results in a ranked order.

**The query consists of the following main parts (Common Table Expressions - CTEs):**

1.  **`email_metrics_cte`**:
    * This CTE focuses on calculating email-related metrics.
    * It joins data from the `DA.session`, `DA.session_params`, `DA.account_session`, `DA.account`, `DA.email_sent`, `DA.email_open`, and `DA.email_visit` tables.
    * It counts the distinct number of emails sent, opened, and visited for each date and country.
    * It also includes columns for `sent_interval`, `is_verified`, `is_unsubscribed`, and `account_cnt`, setting them to 0 in this part of the query.

2.  **`aggregated_metrics_cte`**:
    * This CTE aggregates the metrics calculated in `email_metrics_cte` at the date and country level.
    * It calculates the average `sent_interval` and the sum of `is_verified`, `is_unsubscribed`, `account_cnt`, `email_sent`, `email_open`, and `email_visit` for each unique combination of date and country.

3.  **`ranked_metrics_cte`**:
    * This CTE builds upon the aggregated metrics by calculating the total number of accounts (`total_country_account_cnt`) and the total number of emails sent (`total_country_sent_cnt`) for each country using window functions.

**Finally, the main `SELECT` statement:**

* Ranks the countries based on two criteria:
    * `rank_total_country_account_cnt`: Rank by the total number of accounts in descending order.
    * `rank_total_country_sent_cnt`: Rank by the total number of emails sent in descending order.
* Filters the results to include only the top 10 countries based on either the total account count ranking OR the total sent email count ranking.

**In summary, this query aims to identify the top 10 countries that have the highest number of accounts or the highest volume of sent emails, providing insights into key markets based on user acquisition and email engagement.**
